# Application Configuration Settings
#
# This file centralizes key parameters for the application's behavior
# across different environments, primarily focusing on development and testing.
# Each setting is carefully documented to ensure clarity and maintainability.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# DEMO Mode Activation Flag
#
# Controls whether the application operates in a special demonstration mode.
# When set to 'True', certain features might be enabled or disabled
# to facilitate presentations or quick testing without full data setup.
# This is typically used in non-production environments.
#
DEMO=True

#
# DEMO Data Loading Flag
#
# Specifies if pre-configured, illustrative dataset should be loaded
# upon application startup. This is often coupled with 'DEMO=True'
# to provide immediate, sample data for development or showcasing features.
# Setting this to 'True' usually populates temporary data stores.
#
DEMODATA=True

#
# DEMO User Definition Object
#
# Defines the identity of a default demonstration user.
# This object includes a unique identifier, first name, and surname.
# In demo mode, the application might automatically log in this user,
# or use these credentials for simulated user interactions.
# The 'id' field is a standard UUID for consistent identification.
#
DEMOUSER={"id": "2d9dc5ca-a4a2-11ed-b9df-0242ac120003", "name": "John", "surname": "Newbie"}

#
# GraphQL Endpoint URL Configuration
#
# Specifies the Uniform Resource Locator for the GraphQL API endpoint.
# The application communicates with this endpoint to fetch and manipulate data.
# 'http://localhost:33001/api/gql' points to a local development server instance,
# which is common for local testing and integration of front-end and back-end components.
# This URL should be updated for staging or production deployments.
#
GQLUG_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:33001/api/gql
